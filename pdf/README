  HEP8225 data sheet
  o Up to 14-Core Intel Xeon E5-2600 Processors
  o Two Serial ATA/600 Interfaces 
  o Eight Channel DDR4 Memory Interfaces, DDR4-2400 speeds,
    128GB capacity (16GB DIMMs)
    256GB capacity (32GB DIMMs)
    Up to eight standard DDR4 memory DIMMs are supported on
    the HEP8225 for a total system memory capacity of 256GB when
    using 32GB DIMMs. The HEP8225 takes advantage of the four-
    channel DDR4 memory interface by enabling select Intel Xeon
    E5-2600 v4 Series Processors to deliver system memory speeds
    with peak data transfer rates up to 2400 MT/s per channel. ECC
    registered memory is supported on the HEP8225 and Trenton
    recommends PC4-19200 standard DIMMs for all HEP8225
    processor options.
